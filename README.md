## Building the 2048 Game Application

Main project is `javascript` based, hence you can build the application via `npm`:

```shell
npm install --include=dev

npm run build
```

You can test the application locally, by running below command:

```shell
npm start
```

Above command will start a web server in development mode, which you can access at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Please visit the main library [configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/game-2048#config) section from the public npm registry to see all available options
